Students-Performance-Analysis
Dataset : synthetic dataset

Objectives :

1.To generate a dataset of students using Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Faker.
2.To analyze student performance by calculating:
Total marks Average marks Grades 3.To apply descriptive statistics such as:
Mean Median Mode Standard deviation 4.To classify students into grades (A, B, C, Fail) based on their performance.
5.To identify top-performing students and low-performing (fail) students.
6.To perform group-wise analysis based on:
Department Gender Year 7.To analyze relationships between variables like attendance and average marks using correlation.
8.To visualize data using graphs such as:
Bar chart Histogram Scatter plot 9. understand patterns and trends in student performance.
10.To improve data analysis skills using Python libraries.

Project Highlights :

Data Preprocessing:

Generated dataset using Python libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Faker) Cleaned and structured the data Created new features like Total and Average marks Converted raw data into a usable format for analysis Ensured data consistency and quality

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Used statistical methods: Mean, Median, Mode, Standard Deviation Identified patterns in student performance Compared performance across: Departments Gender Year Found relationships (e.g., Attendance vs Average marks) Detected trends and variations in the dataset

Machine Learning Model :

Applied basic classification logic (Grade system) Categorized students into: A, B, C, Fail Can be extended to use ML algorithms like: Logistic Regression Decision Tree Helps in predicting student performance

Visualization:

Created visual representations using Matplotlib Used different charts: Bar chart → Department-wise performance Histogram → Distribution of marks Scatter plot → Attendance vs Average Made data easy to understand visually Highlighted key insights and trends

Tools and Technologies :

Python pandas numpy Faker

Results:
the project was successfully completed using Python. A dataset of students was created and analyzed to understand their performance. The results show that most students scored average marks, while only a few students got high grades and some failed. The grading system helped to clearly classify students. The statistical analysis (mean, median, mode) shows that overall student performance is moderate. The comparison between departments, gender, and year shows only small differences. The analysis also shows that students with good attendance tend to get better marks. The graphs like bar chart, histogram, and scatter plot helped to easily understand the data and identify patterns. Overall, the project helps to understand student performance and improves data analysis skills.
